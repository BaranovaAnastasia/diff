To compare your texts from command line run:

java -Dfile.encoding=utf-8 -jar TextComparison.jar "<your path to the 1st file>" "<your path to the 2nd file>" "<your path to the output .html file>"

or:

java -Dfile.encoding=utf-8 -jar TextComparison.jar "<your path to the 1st file>" "<your path to the 2nd file>" 

in this case, the result will be saved to the "diff.html" file in the project directory.
